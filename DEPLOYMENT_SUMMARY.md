## 🎯 Quick Start (3 Steps to Fix)

### Step 1: Upload Diagnostic Tool
```
1. Upload check_godaddy_compatibility.php to GoDaddy

```

### Step 2: Fix Database Credentials (Most Common Issue)
```php

$username = "your_godaddy_username";  // Get from cPanel → MySQL Databases
$password = "your_godaddy_password";  // Your DB password
$dbname = "your_godaddy_dbname";      // Your DB name (often prefixed)
```

### Step 3: Upload & Test

## 🔍 Why You're Getting 500 Error

The **500 Internal Server Error** on GoDaddy is almost always caused by one of these:

### 1. ❌ **Wrong Database Credentials** (90% of cases)
- **Problem:** Your production credentials in `pdo_conexion.php` are set to default local values
- **Current values:** `username="root"`, `password=""`, `dbname="aviar"`
- **Fix:** Update with your actual GoDaddy database credentials
- **Where to find:** GoDaddy cPanel → Databases → MySQL Databases

### 2. ❌ **Old PHP Version**
- **Problem:** GoDaddy may be using PHP 5.x (your code needs PHP 7.0+)
- **Fix:** cPanel → Software → Select PHP Version → Choose PHP 7.4 or 8.0

### 3. ❌ **Wrong File Permissions**
- **Problem:** Files have incorrect permissions (e.g., 777 or 600)
- **Fix:** Set files to 644, directories to 755

### 4. ❌ **Database Doesn't Exist**
- **Problem:** You uploaded files but didn't create/import the database
- **Fix:** Create database in cPanel, import your SQL file

### 5. ❌ **.htaccess Syntax Error**
- **Problem:** If you have a .htaccess with errors, it causes 500
- **Fix:** Temporarily rename it to test

## 🧪 Testing Process

### On GoDaddy Server:

1. **Run Compatibility Check:**
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/aviar/check_godaddy_compatibility.php
   ```
   - Look for any RED errors
   - Fix each issue shown

2. **Test Database Connection:**
   - Use the form on the compatibility check page
   - Enter your GoDaddy database credentials
   - Click "Test Connection"
   - Should show GREEN checkmark

3. **Test Main Application:**
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/aviar/inventario_aviar.php
   ```
   - Should load without 500 error

## 📊 File Permissions Guide

### Via FTP Client (FileZilla, etc.):
```
Right-click file → File Permissions → Enter number
```

### Via cPanel File Manager:
```
Right-click → Change Permissions → Enter number
```

### Correct Permissions:
```
PHP files (*.php):           644  (rw-r--r--)
Directories:                 755  (rwxr-xr-x)
uploads/ directory:          755  (or 775 if uploads fail)
.htaccess:                   644  (rw-r--r--)
```

### Wrong Permissions (Don't Use):
```
❌ 777 - Too permissive (security risk)
❌ 600 - Too restrictive (server can't read)
❌ 444 - Read-only (uploads won't work)
```

## 🔐 Security Checklist

- [ ] Remove any test files
- [ ] Verify uploads/ is not publicly browsable
- [ ] Change default passwords
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (if you have SSL certificate)

## 🎓 Understanding the Error

**500 Internal Server Error** means:
- Something in your PHP code failed
- The server can't tell you what (for security)
- The real error is in the PHP error log

**To see the actual error:**
1. Check GoDaddy error logs in cPanel
2. Temporarily enable PHP errors (don't leave on!)
3. Use the diagnostic tool

**Common actual errors behind 500:**
- `PDOException: Access denied` → Wrong database credentials
- `Call to undefined function` → Wrong PHP version or missing extension
- `failed to open stream` → File path wrong or file missing
- `Maximum execution time exceeded` → Script running too long

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. ✅ No 500 error when visiting inventario_aviar.php
2. ✅ Page loads and shows the animal cards
3. ✅ You can add/edit/delete animals
4. ✅ Images upload and display correctly
5. ✅ ChatPDF integration works
6. ✅ No errors in browser console (F12)

## 📝 Notes

- **GoDaddy Shared Hosting:** Has some limitations on execution time and memory
- **Database Names:** GoDaddy often prefixes with your username (e.g., `username_aviar`)
- **File Paths:** Use relative paths (`./file.php`) or absolute with `__DIR__`
- **Debugging:** Use `error_log()` instead of `echo` for debugging in production
- **Caching:** GoDaddy may cache PHP files, wait 2-3 minutes after changes

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Most likely cause:** Wrong database credentials in `pdo_conexion.php`

**Quickest fix:**
1. Get correct credentials from GoDaddy cPanel
2. Update `pdo_conexion.php` lines 17-19
3. Upload
4. Test

**If that doesn't work:**
- Run `check_godaddy_compatibility.php`
- It will tell you exactly what's wrong

**Good luck! 🚀**

*Delete this file and all diagnostic files after successful deployment for security.*
